**Java Adapter Pattern: Making Incompatible Interfaces Compatible**

The Adapter Design Pattern allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together. It acts as a bridge between
 two incompatible interfaces, allowing them to collaborate seamlessly.

**Example:**

Here's an example of an adapter pattern in Java that adapts an older printer interface to a new interface:

```java
// Existing Printer Interface (Incompatible)
interface OldPrinter {
    void print();
}

// New Printer Interface (Expected by Client)
interface NewPrinter {
    void printDocument();
}

// Adapter to Make Old Printer Interface Compatible with New Printer Interface
class PrinterAdapter implements NewPrinter {
    private OldPrinter oldPrinter;

    public PrinterAdapter(OldPrinter oldPrinter) {
        this.oldPrinter = oldPrinter;
    }

    @Override
    public void printDocument() {
        oldPrinter.print();
    }
}

// Client Code
public class AdapterExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        OldPrinter oldPrinter = new OldDotMatrixPrinter();
        NewPrinter newPrinter = new PrinterAdapter(oldPrinter);

        newPrinter.printDocument();
    }
}

// Existing Old Dot Matrix Printer (Incompatible)
class OldDotMatrixPrinter implements OldPrinter {
    @Override
    public void print() {
        System.out.println("Printing with old dot matrix printer");
    }
}
```

**How to Identify When to Apply the Adapter Design Pattern:**

1. **Incompatible Interfaces:** When you have classes/interfaces with incompatible methods that you need to use together.

2. **Reuse Existing Classes:** If you want to reuse existing classes that don't match the expected interface of the client code.

3. **Class Evolution:** When you're working with legacy code or third-party libraries that need to be integrated into your application.

**Where to Apply the Adapter Design Pattern:**

- **Legacy Systems Integration:** When integrating legacy systems with modern codebases that use different interfaces.

- **Third-Party Libraries:** Adapting third-party libraries or components to fit your application's interface requirements.

- **API Evolution:** When an API evolves over time, an adapter can help maintain backward compatibility with older versions.

- **Graphical User Interfaces:** Adapting user interface components to different platforms or frameworks.

- **Testing:** Creating test adapters to isolate components for unit testing or mocking.

By applying the Adapter Design Pattern, you can make incompatible interfaces work together seamlessly, enabling you to integrate
and use components that were not originally designed to work together.
